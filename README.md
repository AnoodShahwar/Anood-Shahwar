### 💭 Who am I?

Hi! I’m Anood, a little quiet, a little cozy, very into building stuff that *feels good to use*.  
Currently figuring out how to turn ideas into apps & games, slowly but surely 🎮📱

- 🛠️ Learning by building; currently exploring Unity + Flutter  
- 🎨 Designing and developing intuitive UIs whether it’s a small game or a chill mobile app  
- 🌱 Still early in my journey, but showing up one line at a time
