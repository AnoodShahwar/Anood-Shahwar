### 💭 Who am I?

Hi! I’m Anood — a little quiet, a little cozy, very into building stuff that *feels good to use*  
Currently figuring out how to turn ideas into apps & games — slowly but surely 🎮📱

- 🛠️ Learning by building — currently exploring Unity + Flutter  
- 🎨 Into clean design, smooth UIs, and small creative projects  
- 🌱 Still early in the journey, but showing up one line at a time
